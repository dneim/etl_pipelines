This was my first attempt at an ETL project.

The code development is courtesy of a wonderful class on Udemy called Writing production-ready ETL pipelines in Python / Pandas by Jan Schwarzlose

This was definetely a code-along exercise for me. I am familair with most of the Python suntax implemented, but was grateful to learn the full 
build-out of integrating boto3 lib with pyarrow, pandas, and the other required components.
