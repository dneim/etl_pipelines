The 5 Jupyter Notebook files represent the systematic build-up of an operational approach to:
   1. Spliting a large CSV file into smaller components (did this for practice, not required for main code)
   2. Reconstituting the CSVs into a master CSV file
   3. Reading that CSV in as pd DataFrame
   4. Applying Transformations
   5. Sending completed report to a given AWS bucket
