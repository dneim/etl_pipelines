With version 6, I have moved all code into clean funcitons and laced functions together where neccessary.

Version 6.1 = Addition of logging. Created a csv file that stoes the filename and timestamp of a completed job
Version 6.2 = Created a logging_sequence function that manages logginf in both local and s3, and integrated funciton into main()
